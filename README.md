PyImgProc
=========

Python Image Processing stuff. I've done lots of MATLAB but I want to give OpenCV a go. I thought it might be neat to combine image processing with scripting to make some at least somewhat usable utilities.

If you want to run any of this you need to have OpenCV for cv2 and NumPy.
