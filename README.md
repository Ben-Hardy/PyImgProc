PyImgProc
=========

Python Image Processing stuff. I've done lots of MATLAB but I want to give OpenCV a go. I thought it might be neat to combine image processing with scripting to make some at least somewhat usable utilities.

If you want to run any of this you need to have OpenCV for cv2 and NumPy. If you have them but are unsure if they are working, run test.py. It will do a basic test to make sure they are in the path correctly and work at a basic level.
